# PO-X Homebrew SDK (Scaffold)

This is a starter layout to organize homebrew projects.
The current emulator uses a placeholder ISA; once real opcodes are known,
update these examples accordingly.

## Examples
- hello_world (writes bytes to VRAM area in the placeholder map)
- sprite_demo (fills VRAM pattern)
- sound_test (writes audio regs)
