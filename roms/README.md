# PO-X Clone Demo ROMs

This folder contains example ROMs for the PO-X clone emulator:

- `demo_vramfill.rom`: Raw binary demo that fills VRAM with a visible pattern.
- `demo_vramfill.poxr`: POXR container version of the above.
- `demo_creature_slot0.rom`: Raw binary demo for the creature/save system (slot 0).
- `demo_creature_slot0.poxr`: POXR container version of the above.

Use these with the emulator or CLI tools for testing and development.
